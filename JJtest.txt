4. Lol, when it comes to politics I'm in the top 1% of understanding. 
I've been watching political coverage every week since I was 14 fucking years old. 
But political novice like you think that you actually have an understanding because 
of the fact you pay attention once every 2 or 4 years. Yeah keep dreaming. 
Bernie could easily come out and say that having the debate during the fucking NCAA finals 
limit exposure to the American people, and that as a true believer in democracy he feels that the 
American people should be given the best chance to hear the information 
necessary for them making their democratic decision. And that he doesn't know why Hillary Clinton 
doesn't want to make the time to reach a large national audience to inform them 
about what she wants to do for the county. And why she would purposely choose the date 
that forces the American people to make a choice between watching the final game of the 
series they've been watching all month, and informing themselves on the difference between 
the Democratic candidates? 
Yeah, I guess politics shouldn't be commented on by people who have no fucking idea what they are talking about.1. Ty's modifying a file lolXDDD
